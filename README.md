# Project Automation with Ansible

## Introduction

This repository contains Ansible playbooks and configurations designed to automate the setup, deployment, and management of my personal projects. By using Ansible, I can ensure that my environments are consistent, reliable, and easily reproducible.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Ansible playbooks, make sure you have the following:

- **Ansible**: Installed on your local machine.
- **Python 3.x**: Required for Ansible to function.
- **SSH Access**: Ensure that you have SSH access to the servers or machines you want to manage.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ELemenoppee/automation-with-ansible.git
    cd automation-with-ansible
    ```

2. **Run the Playbooks**:
    Customize the inventory file (`inventory`) with your own server details, then run the desired playbook:
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks.yml
    ```

## Directory Structure

- `roles/`: Custom roles used by the playbooks.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the playbooks and roles to fit the specific requirements of your projects. The playbooks are modular, allowing you to add or remove tasks as needed.
